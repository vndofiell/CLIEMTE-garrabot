## Quick Start

### Getting Your SSID

To use the API with real data, you need to extract your session ID from the browser:

1. **Open PocketOption in your browser**
2. **Open Developer Tools (F12)**
3. **Go to Network tab**
4. **Filter by WebSocket (WS)**
5. **Look for authentication message starting with `42["auth"`**
6. **Copy the complete message including the `42["auth",{...}]` format**

Example SSID format:
```
42["auth",{"session":"abcd1234efgh5678","isDemo":1,"uid":12345,"platform":1}]
```

If you are unable to find it, try running the automatic SSID scraper under the `tools` folder.

## Common errors

### Authentication timeout or connection immediately closes

If you see errors like:
```
WARNING | pocketoptionapi_async.websocket_client:receive_messages:395 - WebSocket connection closed
WARNING | pocketoptionapi_async.client:_start_regular_connection:245 - Failed to connect to region DEMO: Authentication timeout
```

**Solution**: Your SSID is likely in the wrong format or is expired. Make sure you are using the **complete SSID format**, not just the session ID:

✅ **Correct format:**
```python
SSID = '42["auth",{"session":"n1p5ah5u8t9438rbunpgrq0hlq","isDemo":1,"uid":84402008,"platform":1}]'
```

❌ **Wrong format (just the session):**
```python
SSID = 'dxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'  # This won't work!
```

To get the correct SSID:
1. Open PocketOption in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Filter by "WS" (WebSocket)
5. Look for a message that starts with `42["auth",`
6. Copy the **entire message** including the `42["auth",{...}]` part
